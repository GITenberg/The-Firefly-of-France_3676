description: The restaurant of the Hotel St. Ives seems, as I look back on it, an
  odd spot to have served as stage wings for a melodrama, pure and simple. Yet a melodrama
  did begin there. No other word fits the case. The inns of the Middle Ages, which,
  I believe, reeked with trap-doors and cutthroats, pistols and poisoned daggers,
  offered nothing weirder than my experience, with its first scene set beneath this
  roof.
